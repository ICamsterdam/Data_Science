too few entries

INTKEY          
EXCEPTRSNCODE
EXCEPTRSNDESC
INATTENTIONIND
SPEEDING


*Speeding has really low data as well...but it's very important. Think about it later

not relevant to the objective
INCKEY
COLDETKEY
REPORTNO
STATUS
SEVERITYCODE.1
JUNCTIONTYPE
SDOT_COLCODE

It is kind of relevant, but too difficult to find a way fill in the blanks
COLLISIONTYPE

Missing values. So, as I have the time recorded with no missing data, i'll use that and convert it to 'DAY', 'NIGHT', 'DAWN', ETC

unnecessary
SEVERITYDESC

2. FILLING THE BLANKS
COLLISIONTYPE
  
LIGHTCOND



after getting stuck, decided to keep only:
SEVERITYCODE
UNDERINFL
INCDTTM
WEATHER
ROADCOND
